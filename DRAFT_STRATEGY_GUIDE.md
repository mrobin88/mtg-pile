# 🎯 **Professional MTG Drafting Strategy Guide**

## **Overview: How Pros Make Quick Draft Decisions**

Professional Magic: The Gathering players use systematic approaches to evaluate cards quickly during drafts. This guide covers the key heuristics and frameworks that top players rely on to make optimal picks in limited time.

## **🏆 The BREAD Method (Traditional Limited)**

**BREAD** is the foundational framework for evaluating cards in limited formats:

### **B - Bombs (40% of evaluation weight)**
- **Definition**: Cards that can single-handedly win the game
- **Examples**: Planeswalkers, powerful rares/mythics, game-ending creatures
- **Quick Check**: "Does this card win the game if unanswered?"
- **Priority**: Always pick bombs first, regardless of color

### **R - Removal (30% of evaluation weight)**
- **Definition**: Cards that deal with opponent's threats
- **Types**: Destroy, exile, damage, bounce, counterspells
- **Quick Check**: "Can this answer a problematic card?"
- **Priority**: High - removal is scarce and valuable

### **E - Evasion (20% of evaluation weight)**
- **Definition**: Creatures that are hard to block
- **Keywords**: Flying, unblockable, menace, shadow, intimidate
- **Quick Check**: "Can this creature attack profitably?"
- **Priority**: Medium-high - evasion wins games

### **A - Aggro (10% of evaluation weight)**
- **Definition**: Efficient creatures for attacking
- **Quick Check**: "Power ≥ CMC and toughness ≥ CMC-1?"
- **Priority**: Medium - good curve fillers

### **D - Duds (0% of evaluation weight)**
- **Definition**: Everything else
- **Priority**: Last resort picks

## **📊 Quadrant Theory (Modern Limited)**

Quadrant Theory evaluates how good a card is in different game states:

### **Opening (Early Game)**
- **When**: Turns 1-3
- **Good Cards**: Low CMC creatures, ramp, early interaction
- **Quick Check**: "Is this good on turn 1-3?"

### **Developing (Mid-Game)**
- **When**: Turns 4-6
- **Good Cards**: Mid-range creatures, card draw, removal
- **Quick Check**: "Is this good when developing board?"

### **Parity (Behind)**
- **When**: Losing or at parity
- **Good Cards**: Removal, card draw, defensive creatures
- **Quick Check**: "Does this help when behind?"

### **Winning (Ahead)**
- **When**: Winning or ahead on board
- **Good Cards**: Evasion, finishers, protection
- **Quick Check**: "Does this help close out the game?"

## **🎨 Color and Format Considerations**

### **Limited Format Priorities**
1. **Curve**: 2-3 drops are premium, 6+ drops are situational
2. **Synergy**: Cards that work together > individual power
3. **Mana Efficiency**: Power ≥ CMC for creatures
4. **Removal**: Always prioritize removal spells
5. **Evasion**: Flying creatures win limited games

### **Standard Format Priorities**
1. **Power Level**: Raw card power matters most
2. **Meta Relevance**: Does it answer current threats?
3. **Rotation Safety**: Will it survive format changes?
4. **Efficiency**: Low CMC, high impact
5. **Synergy**: Works with top-tier strategies

### **Modern Format Priorities**
1. **Raw Power**: Highest power level cards
2. **Combo Potential**: Enables or protects combos
3. **Meta Relevance**: Answers to top strategies
4. **Efficiency**: Low CMC, high impact
5. **Flexibility**: Multiple uses or modes

### **Commander Format Priorities**
1. **Synergy**: Works with commander strategy
2. **Card Advantage**: Draw, tutor, or generate value
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple uses or modes
4. **Power Level**: High-impact effects
5. **Mana Cost**: Reasonable CMC for format

## **⚡ Quick Decision Framework**

### **30-Second Card Evaluation**
1. **Check CMC**: Is this curve-appropriate?
2. **Identify Type**: Creature, removal, or utility?
3. **BREAD Rating**: Where does it fall in BREAD?
4. **Quadrant Check**: Which game states is it good in?
5. **Format Fit**: Does it work in this format?

### **Red Flags (Avoid These)**
- **High CMC + Low Impact**: 6+ mana cards that don't win
- **No Synergy**: Cards that don't work with your strategy
- **Situational**: Cards only good in specific scenarios
- **Color Intensive**: Hard to cast in limited
- **Low Power**: Creatures with power < CMC

### **Green Flags (Pick These)**
- **Low CMC + High Impact**: 1-3 mana cards that matter
- **Removal**: Any card that answers threats
- **Evasion**: Flying, unblockable, or hard-to-block creatures
- **Card Advantage**: Draw, tutor, or generate value
- **Synergy**: Works with your archetype

## **🎯 Archetype-Specific Strategies**

### **Aggro Decks**
- **Priority**: 1-3 drop creatures, burn spells, combat tricks
- **Avoid**: High CMC cards, defensive spells
- **Key**: Curve out and pressure opponent

### **Control Decks**
- **Priority**: Removal, card draw, defensive creatures
- **Avoid**: Low-impact creatures, aggressive spells
- **Key**: Survive early game, win late

### **Midrange Decks**
- **Priority**: Efficient creatures, removal, card advantage
- **Avoid**: Extremely high or low CMC cards
- **Key**: Value trades and card advantage

### **Combo Decks**
- **Priority**: Combo pieces, tutors, protection
- **Avoid**: Cards that don't advance combo
- **Key**: Find and protect combo pieces

## **🔍 Advanced Evaluation Techniques**

### **Context Matters**
- **Pack 1**: Take best card, stay open
- **Pack 2**: Commit to colors, prioritize synergy
- **Pack 3**: Fill holes, optimize curve

### **Signal Reading**
- **Strong Signals**: Multiple good cards in one color
- **Weak Signals**: Mediocre cards in one color
- **Open Colors**: Colors with few good cards

### **Curve Considerations**
- **Ideal Curve**: 2-3 two-drops, 3-4 three-drops, 2-3 four-drops
- **Avoid**: Too many 1-drops or 6+ drops
- **Balance**: Mix of creatures and spells

## **🎓 Pro Tips for Quick Decisions**

### **Memorize These Heuristics**
1. **"Removal > Everything"**: Always pick removal over non-removal
2. **"Flying Wins"**: Evasive creatures are premium in limited
3. **"Power ≥ CMC"**: Good creatures have power equal to or greater than CMC
4. **"2-3 Drops Win"**: Early creatures determine limited games
5. **"Synergy > Power"**: Cards that work together beat individual power

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Overvaluing Rares**: Not all rares are bombs
- **Ignoring Curve**: Picking high CMC cards early
- **Color Locking**: Committing to colors too early
- **Ignoring Synergy**: Picking cards that don't work together
- **Underestimating Removal**: Passing removal for mediocre creatures

### **Speed Techniques**
- **Scan CMC First**: Quick CMC check eliminates many cards
- **Look for Keywords**: Flying, removal, card draw are obvious
- **Check Power/Toughness**: Power ≥ CMC is quick math
- **Ignore Flavor Text**: Focus on mechanics, not story
- **Use BREAD Order**: Evaluate in priority order
