## üìä **How Meta Analysis Works**

### **Data Collection:**
1. **Tournament Scraping**: Fetch results from major tournaments
2. **Deck Aggregation**: Count archetype appearances and performance
3. **Meta Calculation**: Determine meta share percentages
4. **Tier Assignment**: Rank decks based on meta share and win rates

### **Tier System:**
- **Tier 1**: Top 50% of meta or top 15 archetypes
- **Tier 2**: 0.2%+ meta share, competitive but not dominant
- **Tier 3**: <0.2% meta share, rogue decks and experimental builds

### **Performance Metrics:**
- **Meta Share**: Percentage of total tournament decks
- **Win Rate**: Overall performance across tournaments
- **Top 8 Rate**: Frequency of reaching elimination rounds
- **Tournament Wins**: Number of 1st place finishes
